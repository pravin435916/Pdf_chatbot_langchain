explanation of how I built the PDF-based chatbot using the Groq key:

PDF Upload & Parsing:

Used PyPDF2 to read and extract text from the uploaded PDF file.
Embedding and Indexing:

Employed SentenceTransformers to convert PDF text into vector embeddings.
Used Faiss to create an index for efficient similarity search across the document.
Question Handling:

When the user asks a question, the app:
Converts the query into an embedding.
Searches the Faiss index for the most relevant parts of the PDF.
Response Generation:

Sent the relevant context from the PDF and the user's query to Groq Chat (via langchain-groq) for generating an intelligent, contextual response.
Streamlit Interface:

Built an interactive frontend using Streamlit to:
Upload PDFs.
Display a chat interface for user queries and responses.
Key Features:

Works entirely with Groq for LLM processing.
Provides direct, accurate responses from the uploaded PD
